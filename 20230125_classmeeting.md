# Jan 25 Class Notes

asynchronous serial communication: (RS - 232)
Sender and receiver not at the same time.
Sender is sending, receiver is  keeping up.

synchronous serial communicaiton: (I2C, SPI, 1-wire)
Hardware > synchronous on that level.

Serial Monitor: found on bottom of screen.
If you click -> and it says something about the serial port being unavailable, then click -> again.

View -> Terminal
If you'd like to close the serial terminal, then hover and click trash can.

Companies:

- SparkFun
- ADAFruit
- PoLolu

FFT: filtering out certain frequencies.

Load cell (w/ amplifyer): determine weight.

## Soldiering Circuit Boards

Either surface mount or through hole.
Thin layer of copper w/ fiberglass in between.

Copper connects > pins
Soldier mask > green
Fiberglass is everywhere coppper isn't.
pads: places where traces end.
(insert image of trace and pad)

JLC PCB - factory makes circuit boards.

Paperbased circuit boards: FR1
Fiberglass: FR4

white - silk screen - labels

via: hole with nothing in it.
Plated holes that makes the transition from bottom to top.

refdes

22 gauge wires.
Solid wire: bend it and it stays.
Stranded: looks like a tiny rope.

Keep soldiering iron temp in the middel 325Â°

Drop of soldier on tip of iron > helps heat the componenets.
Tinning the tip/wire.
