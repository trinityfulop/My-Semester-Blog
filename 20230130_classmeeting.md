# Jan 30 Class Notes

We discussed our plans for the midterm projects.

Before this class meeting started, I had been a little confused as to what direction our projects should heading in. I ended up coming with a few "app ideas" rather than midterm project ideas.

Here are some of my sketches:

(Insert sketch images from sketchbook)

As we discussed the ideas of my classmate's I began to have a better sense of what we were doing.

I had 2-3 stronger ideas that I wanted to discuss.

- 1. 360Â° mirror.
I wanted to create a mirror that whenever a person would stand in front of it to try and look in the mirror, it would abruptly spin away from the viewer.

This was inspired by my ungodly amount of screentime and the idea of your own reflection almost rejecting you in a way.

- 2. was a silent dark room that when someone entered, the sounds would make little glowing eyes appear. We discussed whether it would be activated by direct noise stimulation or possibly na accumulation of noise.
I wanted to kind of combine this with another idea of stars, so the less movement & light, the more stars would appear.

- 3. A tiny heart that would pump weights based on heart rate.

- 4. Water Waster. A tiny plant that grows or shrinks/ blooms or wilts as water goes down a sink drain.
