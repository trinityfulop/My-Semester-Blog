# Feb. 01 Class Meeting

We once again discussed Midterm Project ideas.

I have decided on a project. I'm planning on creating the mirror that spins away from the viewer as they try to look at it.
During class we discussed some way I can accomplish this project, one of them being simplifying the project itself.

For example, rather than having the mirror spin 360°, mount it to a wall/table and only allow it to spin 180°.

Using the servo motor and have the mirror move jerkily rather than a smooth spinning motion. (Play up the comedic aspect)

By using a plastic mirror rather than an actual glass one, it would lessen the weight on the motor. This seems to be the biggest hurdle of this project. Not putting too much weight/force on the motor.

(Insert New Sketch Ideas for Mirror)

Some ideas to add support:

- A railing support below the mirror, this is to lessen the downward and front/back force.

- Adding supports to both the bottom and the top, framing the mirror with something.

I'm sure as more issues pop up I will have to come up with more/better solutions.
