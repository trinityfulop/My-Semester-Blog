# Jan 19 Class Meeting

## What is interactivity?

interaction: what do we want to happen. We want to draw out the amount of time that viewers evalutate/observe the artwork.
interaction > technical

libraries: collection of code someone else wrote

<!-- Ever grab an arduino software > include Arduino.h > #include <arduino.h>  at the top -->

GPIO: general purpose input & output

Arduino Uno Pins > our microcontroller

## Analog vs. Digital

Analog: spectrum

Digital: either on/off
high/low
Binary.

DAC: digital to analog converter
ADC: analog to digital converter

PWM: pulse width modulation (dimming an LED) > DAC

## Input vs. Output

| **Input**    | **Output** |
|  switch  |  light  |
|   sound (mic)  |  speaker |
|   movement (sensor)      |  LCD display |
|  light (sensor) | motor |
|   | relay |

user friendliness: how much does the viewer need to know

Our microcontroller works on 5V but a lot of other modern microcontrollers work on 3.3V

Set-up & Loop - arduino thing
