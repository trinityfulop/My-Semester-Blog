# Class Meeting Notes For March 19th

Today we briefly went over my final project ideas, as I missed class on Monday and I didn't share mine.

I had two stronger ideas I was thinking about:

1. Wringing Water
2. Mascara Application

Wringing Water - for this idea I want to emulate the motion of wringing water out of a rag/sponge. This feels like such an inately human action and I can't think of a good reason as to why a machine/robot would wring water out of cloth this way and for what purpose.

Mascara Application - I think it's funny that people make the same face when they apply mascara so to have a screen or a machine imitate that would be interesting. My idea for this was to use some type of computer vision to recognize a face with their mouth open and then have an arm swip up and down while a "mouth" opens.

Circuit boards demo.
We went up to the FAB LAB and sat through the circuit board demo using Carbide Copper, but when using it we would have ot go in and edit the gcode, so this is not the exact how to on the circuit board making yet. Rob has added to a website that may be sueful, so he may uplaod a new video on how to do it using that. Not sure yet.
