# Midterm Project Progress Update #1

I have finally decided on an idea.

I want to make a mirror that rotates when a person tries looking at it. I want to use either light sensors (photresistors) or maybe the ultrasonic sensor for this project. So far I haven't decided yet.

We've talked about the weight of the mirror and the 6 degrees of force, making sure there's not too much force on the motors.

Originally I wanted to do 360° and have a smooth movement from the mirror, but I've adjusted the project idea so that it is 180° and uses the servo motor.

I have been testing out the servo motor and making it move based off of one photoresitor just to see the connection between them.

I think I will be splitting them up so that I can focus entirely on the photresitors and making them work independent of the servo motor and then later joining them.

Now to get 5 photoresistors and figure out a light source.
