# Midterm Project Progress Update #2

I'm still collecting materials.

I do not have a mirror yet, as it has to be light enough to not impact the servo. I'm struggling with the design of the table I plan to place the mirror on top of. I'm not sure if I want it to be a complete table with separate light sources, or if I want it to be something place on a table.

I'm also not sure if I want it to be rounded or actually have 5 separate sides.

I have finally acquired 5 photoresistors for the project. I have been working with the coding for two, but I needed more in order to see how they interact.

Using the Joystick threshold lab, I have been able to figure out the coding for threshold of the lights.

When wiring the 5 photoresitors, two of them would not for the life of me work. I sat with them for quite some time trying to figure out what was wrong so I brought them into class, Rob immediately saw the issues within 30 secs. One was chipped and the other had the 5V and GND backwards.

For the light source, I got some flashlights that were on sale. I know they're battery operated and probably not the best for the job, but having an individual light source that's identical for each of the lights feels like the most straightforward solution.
