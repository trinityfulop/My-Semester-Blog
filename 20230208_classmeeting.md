# Feb. 8 Class Meeting Notes

Capacitor and resistors are oftne located together. When you see thigns right next to eachother you can assume they may have something to do with eachother

microwaves have ac synchronous power.

inputpullup > prevents short circuiting. allows it not be floating,

"debouce the switch" > may or may not matter, like turning on a fan vs counting button clicks.
Can debounce throuhg hardware, but if we can do it in the software why not?

*What am I trying to do?* ----> Translate that into code.

Joystick Lab

This lab will help me with the lgiht sensor, as I want to know when it crosses a threshold.

Surplus center > sells larger electronic equipment

## Servos

servos draw current all the time.
1 servo can be connected to 5v (but do not reccommend?)
Do NOT plug in multiple servos into the arduino.

mulptiple power sources > grounds have to connect

Can NOT plus 5v into power converter.

## Wallwart

Wallwart Adapter
AC in
Dc out (VDC)

110-120 V
50-60 Hz

*How many volts?* push
*What is the current (amps)?* pull

Switching vs Linear

Switching > regulated maintains the right voltage
Linear > unsophisticated things like vaccuum cleaner. NOT regulated.
Linear are heavier than switching.

To Do

- figure out light sensors & placement
- make the connection between the light sensor and moving the servo motor.
- build prototype - sull size.
