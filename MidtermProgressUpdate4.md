# Midterm Project Progress Update #4

I have crafted the pedestal, I used foam board to cover the interior wood supports.

I plan on covering the exterior with joint compound and then painting in order to give it a more seamless look.

I still need to

- soldier wires.
- 3D print mirror support
- make light holders.
- joint compound and paint. (possibly?)
- connect servo.
- attach wires & power source, insert to pedestal.
- bring it all to CAB for presentation.
