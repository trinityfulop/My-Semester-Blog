# Midterm Project progress Update #3

I found a mirror! Well - Maggie (from MasterCraftsman) found one and gave it to me. It's a little dirty, but I think 91% alcohol will work to get the glue off. It's super lightweight, so it should work perfectly.

I now have to solder the wires for the photoresistor circuits, but I didn't realize the FAB Lab hours would fall so outside of my schedule. I will have to find some time on Tuesday to solder them.
This puts me farther behind schedule than I was planning, but it will be okay.

On Friday, I found an old pedastal that can work as the base for my table. It's entirely black, which is what I was already planning for the table to be. Now I have to find some poster board, or maybe foam to cover up the edges and give it a sleeker, rounder look. Also to hide the wires.

I've started messing around with TinkerCad in order to create a holder for the mirror. The mirror is only 3 mm wide, so I feel like 3D printing a holder would be better than physically making one out of like wood or metal.

I think I'm changing the way in which the mirror rotates. Originally I wanted it to extended on an arm with something supporting it underneath, but now I think I will just have it rotate in place so there is less force being exerted on the motor.
