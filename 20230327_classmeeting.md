# Class Meeting Notes for March 27th

This class we focused on pulleys and chains. The differences between intersecting gear and chains/pulleys.

Notes are in my sketchbook.

Why add mechanisms of our own:

1. Change the KIND of motion
2. Translate the LOCATION of the movement
3. Change the SPEED/POWER of the motor.

6 Simple Machines:

- Wheel
- Screw
- Lever
- Pulley
- Inlcined PLane
- Wedge (portable inclined plane?)
